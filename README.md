This ionic thruster is made completely out of 3d printed along with an aliexpress high voltage module and some M3 hex screws. The ring for the emitter is 3d printed and then electroplated only using common household materials

The electroplating process was as follows: 
- Cover the 3d printed ring with hairspray or some stick material
- Coat the part with graphite powder. This will initially give the part some conductivity
- Dry the hairspray with hot air (I used a hairdryer)
- Prepare a Copper(III) Sulfate solution (its a typical pool chemical)
- Attach the cathode to some copper (I used a pipe) and place it in the solution. \
- Put the anode to the part and place it in the soltion
- Put the power supply to roughly 5 volts and let it electroplate!
